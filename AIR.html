        Modern sneaker culture had its roots in the air; that is, the original Air Jordan that released in 1985. Nike, and subsequently the Jordan Brand, has honored<br> this iconic silhouette numerous times since with releases of the Retro 1.<br>

        The Chicago Bulls used their third overall draft pick on Jordan, a 1982 NCAA champion who would go on to win Olympic gold later in the summer of 1984.<br> Jordan signed a five-year endorsement deal with Nike, reportedly worth $2.5 million (plus royalties), an enormous outlay for an athlete who hadn't yet proven<br> himself on the professional level.<br>
        
        The NBA banned the original Air Jordan for not meeting the league's stringent policy on uniforms and colors. Jordan wore them anyway and faced a $5,000-<br>per-game fine as a result. Recognizing a unique marketing opportunity when it presented itself, Nike happily paid the fine. And MJ rocked them all the way to<br> his Rookie of the Year honor.<br>
        
        This Air Jordan was the only one in the series to feature the familiar Nike Swoosh logo. And predating the Jumpman logo, the OG shoe featured the Wings<br> logo - a basketball with wings stretching from both sides and "Air Jordan" printed above the ball. Nike filed the Wings logo as a trademark on May 7, 1985.<br>
        
        Leather overlays on the upper offered durability and easy color blocking, and a perforated leather toe box lent ventilation. <br><br>

        Nike faced a unique challenge following the unprecedented success of the original Air Jordan; how to follow it up. The popularity of the shoe's namesake,<br> Michael Jordan, already had begun outgrowing his home country, and Nike went to Italy to produce the Air Jordan II.<br>

        While this nod to internationally renowned Italian style was the first - and to date, only - Air Jordan produced in that country, it wasn't the only first for the<br> franchise. Bruce Kilgore, who also had designed the Air Force One, made the AJ II the first to not feature Nike's familiar Swoosh logo. "Nike" appeared across<br> the top of the heel counter, and the Wings logo of the original Air Jordan was on the tongue.<br>
        
        The AJ II shared a silhouette with the Nike Air Python that released in 1987, including a faux lizard skin upper and swooping lines that resembled those of a<br> sports car (which would factor prominently into the Jordan line in years to come). Known among sneaker collectors as the first "luxury" basketball shoe, the<br> AJ II paved the way for the heat that would accompany the Air Jordan III.<br>
        
        In the testing phase for the AJ II, Jordan wore a prototype that featured the upper of the original Air Jordan fused with the cushioning of the AJ II. The new<br> edition included a full-length Air-Sole unit meant to add extra cushioning for Jordan's sore feet. He only got to wear the AJ II for 18 games due to a broken<br> foot.<br><br>

        If the basketball world was still getting to know Michael Jordan, the ad campaign surrounding the Air Jordan III introduced one prominent playground baller<br> who knew MJ, and MJ's increasingly prominent shoes, all too well.<br>

Released in 1988, the rollout of the AJ III included TV spots featuring actor/director Spike Lee as Mars Blackmon, from his 1986 film "She's Gotta Have It"<br> sparking a series of catch phrases heard 'round the sneaker world.<br>

Architect-turned-designer Tinker Hatfield took the lead on this, the first of more than two dozen Air Jordans he would go on to design. Hatfield sparked some<br> style trends on the AJ III that have continued well into the 21st century. Most notably, he introduced elephant print overlays on the upper that have resurfaced<br> periodically - in reissues of the AJ III as well as other Jordan models - ever since.<br>

Prior to the AJ III, basketball shoes were mostly just basketball shoes. Hatfield knew Jordan was into luxury and rolled that into the designs for Jordan's<br> signature shoes. While the Air Jordan II featured luxurious elements reflected in its Italian construction, Hatfield took this concept to a new level, even<br> involving Jordan in the search for the right leathers to use on the shoe.<br>

Another first on the Air Jordan III; it was the first Jordan signature sneaker to feature the now-famous Jumpman logo. The now-ubiquitous image is a<br> silhouette of Jordan dunking on a 1985 Nike poster.<br>

Finally, the shoe was the first Air Jordan to feature a visible Air-Sole unit under the heel. It retained Nike's "Air" embroidery on the heel, encapsulated Air in the<br> forefoot, and a polyurethane midsole for cushioning.<br>

Jordan averaged 35 points per game while wearing the AJ III to a fourth straight All-Star Game. There, among the game's elite, MJ earned MVP and a second<br> straight Slam Dunk title, this time by flying in from the free-throw line.<br>

The AJ III was first retro'd in 1994.<br><br>

        Following the success of the Air Jordan III, designer Tinker Hatfield delivered one of the more comfortable Air Jordans in the series, the Air Jordan IV.<br>

        The Jumpman logo made its second appearance on the tongue but with the word "Flight" added below it.<br>
        
        Carrying over from the AJ III were the sculpted midsole and the visible Air unit and padded tongue and collar.<br>
        
        The sneaker world was introduced to nubuck with the upper of the Air Jordan IV. The AJ IV featured mesh for the first time, increasing breathability. Multiple<br> areas of the AJ IV featured plastic. A lean triangular plastic piece attached to the nubuck heel was connected to a hard plastic lace holder. The lace holder <br> the forefoot added lockdown.<br>
        
        A plastic heel tab that read "Nike Air" was similar to that of the AJ III. Also on the upper, a plastic grid pattern that lay over the breathable mesh and behind<br> the triangular piece.<br>
        
        Mars Blackmon returned to the ad campaign marketing the shoe, continuing a relationship that has continued - to varying degrees - well into the 21st century.<br>
        
        Ten years after its original release, Nike retro'd the AJ IV in 1999; it sold out immediately.<br>
        
        Wearing the AJ IV, MJ was voted to his fifth consecutive All-Star game and won the league scoring title for the third consecutive year. One of the most<br> memorable AJ IV moments was when Michael hit the series-clinching, hanging jumper over Cleveland's Craig Ehlo in the first round of the playoffs - better<br> known as "The Shot"<br><br>
